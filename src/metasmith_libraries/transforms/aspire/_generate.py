"""The ASPIRE topology, in one table, and the generator that emits it.

`research/aspire/upstream/ASPIRE/asv_pipeline.nf` is 45 hand-wired Nextflow processes. This file
is the port of that wiring into a typed graph: `TABLE` has one row per ported
process, and running this module writes both `data_types/aspire.yml` and every
stub transform under `transforms/aspire/`.

Why a generator rather than fifty hand-written files: this pass exists to *look*
at the topology and decide what to merge, so collapsing two nodes has to be a
table edit, not a sweep. Once the stub bodies start becoming real protocols this
module stops being authoritative -- regenerating would clobber them. Delete it
then, or keep it as the record of where each transform came from.

Three things the port does to the source pipeline, each recorded per row:

* **`.done` sentinels are not ported.** A sentinel stood for an artifact the
  next process re-opened by absolute path out of a shared staging directory. The
  artifact is what gets declared -- a named file where one was read, a directory
  where one was scanned.
* **Optional stages that have downstream consumers are gated on a policy
  token.** Nextflow expressed them by *rebinding* the channel its consumers
  read; there is no rebinding here, so instead two transforms produce the same
  consumer-facing type and each requires a different sibling token. The driver
  registers exactly one, so the losing arm has no candidates and is never
  instantiated. Purely terminal optional stages need no token: you get them by
  asking for their output.
* **Plot-only processes are folded into the transform that computed their
  tables** (see `folds=` on the rows).

Run it:

    python transforms/aspire/_generate.py            # write types + stubs
    python transforms/aspire/_generate.py --lint      # check extends: subsumption
