NAME = "metagenomics_from_paired_reads"
DESCRIPTION = """
Full metagenomics workflow from paired short reads: QC, assembly, ORF calling,
functional annotation, three binners with quality filtering and dereplication,
and contig-, bin- and SSU-level taxonomy.
"""

# The three binners fan out per-binner checkm and gtdbtk instances. Each entry
# below is either a type name or `{type, parents:[i]}` naming an earlier entry;
# without the parent constraint the planner is free to satisfy checkm and gtdbtk
# from whichever single binner it likes.
#
# The same constraint runs one level higher, and for a sharper reason: every
# assembly-derived target is pinned to the megahit assembly (index 0). Since
# `spades_assembly` joined `megahit_assembly` under `sequences::assembly`, an
# unpinned target is satisfiable from either, so the planner is free to answer
# each one from a different assembler -- it did, running BOTH and splitting the
# downstream work across them (35 steps rather than 29, when it last completed).
# The duplication is not confined to the assemblers: every tool between the
# assembly and a target runs once per leg, `prodigal` included.
#
# What that ambiguity costs is NOT the search: unpinned, the search still finds
# the plan in 0.8 s and 30 MB. It is the refiner, which scores 110,866 candidate
# re-bindings of the unpinned plan per iteration against 755 for this one, keeps
# every one of them, and returns the plan it was handed either way. Unpinned this
# target set is 4 min 6 s and 16.7 GB; pinned, 1.6 s and 0.11 GB. The earlier
# ~190 s / 6 GB figure was the python solver and no longer holds. Measurements in
# data/metasmith/plans/08-where-the-unpinned-solve-goes.md.
