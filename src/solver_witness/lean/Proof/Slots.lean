  `shape` and `derived` -- the two clauses decided by comparing DENSE BIT SETS.

  Read `Proof/Basis.lean` first for the loop recipe, and `Proof/Bits.lean` for
  the four `bits` primitives these clauses rest on. What follows is what a clause
  whose conjunct is a SET EQUALITY needs on top of that, and one finding that
  matters more than the proofs.

  ## The finding: neither clause is independent of `indexed`

  `lib.rs` says the ten clauses are independent -- "every accessor is total, so a
  malformed plan produces a meaningless ancestry table and is rejected by
  `Indexed` anyway ... which is what lets the proof be one equation with ten
  lemmas rather than a chain where each rests on the last". For these two that is
  NOT TRUE, and the reason is the representation rather than the judgement.

  `same_slots a b nn` is `bits::eq(of_ids(nn, a), of_ids(nn, b))`, and `of_ids`
  writes exactly `nn` bits. An id at or beyond `nn` sets no bit, so it is
  INVISIBLE to the comparison. What the checker decides is therefore not
  `SolverSpec.SameSet a b` but `SameSetLt nn a b` -- agreement below `nn` only.
  `derived_at` has the same shape at `ne = nEndpoints q`.

  So the unconditional clause lemma the obligation would like,

      clauses.cl_shape p q ⦃ r => r = decide (∀ s ∈ steps q, Shape p s) ⦄

  is FALSE. Take a problem with NO nodes and one transform that requires nothing
  and produces one empty group, and a plan whose one step binds slot `0`. Then `nn = 0`,
  both bit sets are empty, `shape_at` accepts -- while `Shape` demands
  `SameSet [0] []`, which fails. `shapeR_not_shape` and `derivedR_not_derived`
  below are that gap, machine checked. The `derived` instance is the same shape
  one level down: an endpoint whose declared parent is `5` in a plan with one
  endpoint. Both were also run against the crate: `cl_shape` and `cl_derived`
  return `true` on them, and `cl_indexed` is the only clause that returns
  `false`.

  Two theorems are proved for each clause, and the pair is the honest answer:

  - `cl_shape_raw_spec` / `cl_derived_raw_spec` -- UNCONDITIONAL and exact, over
    `ShapeR` / `DerivedR`, which are the specification's `Shape` / `Derived` with
    every set comparison confined to the table the bits index.
  - `cl_shape_spec` / `cl_derived_spec` -- the conjunct of `SolverSpec.ValidC`
    verbatim, under `WellIndexed p q`, which is clause 0.

  `check` is still correct, and `check_spec` still goes through: `check` is the
  CONJUNCTION of the ten, so either `cl_indexed` is false -- and then both
  `check` and `Valid` are false -- or `WellIndexed` holds and the two lemmas
  above apply. The assembler has to make that case split rather than composing
  ten unconditional equations. The alternative repair is in the Rust: have
  `same_slots` and `derived_at` reject an id at or beyond the width they compare
  at, instead of ignoring it.

  ## Namespacing

  Everything general lives in `SolverProof.Slots`. The sibling clause modules
  already carry their own copies of `ok_spec` and `vec_index_ok`, and two modules
  declaring one name in `SolverProof` cannot be imported together. Only the
  theorems named after a `clauses::` function sit at `SolverProof`, where they
  cannot collide.

  `required_slots_spec` and `no_repeat_spec` are SHARED with the `indexed`
  clause, which calls `no_repeat` on `required_slots`. Both are stated for every
  transform id, in range or not.

  ## What the recipe in `Basis` does not say

  **`as` is a token.** `| cons a as ih =>` does not parse in this project:
  Aeneas's `step ... as` claims the identifier, and the error is "unexpected
  token 'as'; expected command", pointing at a line whose `induction` was fine.

  **Basis's postcondition rule extends to `Slice`.** A `decide` postcondition may
  not mention a `Slice`'s `.val` either -- `Decidable` synthesis runs at
  `instances` transparency and will not unfold it. Every `decide`-carrying
  statement below hoists its list to a parameter with a defining equation: `L`,
  `prod`, `decl`, `grp`, `u`, `sv`.

  **`rw [← hL]` is a dependent motive failure whenever `L` indexes a `getElem`.**
  `hL : l.map (·.val) = L` cannot be used right-to-left in a goal mentioning
  `L[j]'h`, because `h : j < L.length` is part of the motive. `subst hL` is fine,
  and it is why `ids_getElem!` and `pairs_getElem!` are stated over `getElem!`
  and proved by `subst`. `drop_cons_getElem!` is the `drop` idiom's head lemma in
  the same form, and mentions no `Slice` at all.

  **A `Nodup` conjunct wants two loops at two different lists.** `no_repeat`'s
  inner loop starts at `i + 1`, so the correspondence is over PAIRS, not over a
  decreasing prefix of one list. The `drop` idiom still applies, twice: the outer
  scan owes `(L.drop i).Nodup` and the inner owes `L[i]! ∉ L.drop j`, and
  `List.nodup_cons` is the single lemma that joins them at `j = i + 1`. Nothing
  else about the pair structure is needed.

  **A search loop is the `drop` idiom with `||` for `&&`.** `matches_declared`
  stops at the first declared group equal to the step's one product group, and
  the specification states that as `∃ d ∈ decl, ...`. State the loop as
  `r = (hit || decide (∃ d ∈ decl.drop g, ...))`; the inductive step is
  `List.exists_mem_cons`, one head and one tail, exactly as `∀` is for a scan.

  **`rw [decide_eq_decide.mpr h]` leaves a `Decidable` instance as a side goal.**
  Rewriting under `decide` asks for the instance at the NEW proposition, and it
  is reported as "unsolved goals" naming a `Decidable`. Close a `Bool` equation
  with `Bool.eq_iff_iff.mpr`, then `simp only [Bool.and_eq_true,
  decide_eq_true_eq]`, and finish on the `Iff` where no instance is in play.

  **`step` normalises the program, and that retires `Access.index_eq`.** `step`
  simplifies with `step_simps`, one of which rewrites `Vec.index` to
  `Vec.index_usize`. After the first `step` in a proof, `rw [index_eq ...]`
  reports "did not find an occurrence of the pattern" for an index that is
  plainly there. `vec_index_usize_ok` is the same equation at the normalised
  head.

  **Pass a `deref`-typed hypothesis, never rewrite with it.** `same_slots` takes
  `Slice`s obtained by `Vec.deref`, and a lemma proved about `v.val` is accepted
  for `(deref v).val` by `exact` -- the two are defeq. `rw [hv]` on the same pair
  is refused, because `rw` matches syntactically.

  **An `ok` flag is a `&&` in the postcondition.** Every loop here carries one.
  State the spec as `r = (ok1 && decide P)`, `split` on the flag first, and the
  `false` branch is one `ok_post`. The recursive call that receives a computed
  flag then needs no case analysis on it at all -- `ih _ i2` takes it as given.

  **`rw [← hsv]` usually wants a trailing `rfl`.** `sv.produced` rewrites back to
  `(stepView s).produced`, and the remaining step to `pairLists s.produced` is
  delta on `stepView`, which `rw`'s closing `rfl` will not do.

/-! ## `no_repeat` -- the one loop whose correspondence is over PAIRS

SHARED with the `indexed` clause, which calls it on `required_slots`. The inner
loop starts at `i + 1`, so the postcondition cannot be a decreasing prefix of one
list: the outer scan owes `Nodup` of the suffix, and the inner scan owes that ONE
element is absent from a suffix. `List.nodup_cons` is the join between them, and
it is the only place a `Nodup` conjunct needs anything beyond the `drop`
idiom. -/
