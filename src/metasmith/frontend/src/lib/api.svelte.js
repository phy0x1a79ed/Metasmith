// user hit) from "invalid" (a bad form) from "error" (a bug), and callers can
// branch on `kind` when it matters -- and a request that never arrives at all
// is a fourth kind, "offline", which no route can report because no route ran.
//
// The module is `.svelte.js` because the service holds `$state`: components
// read `api.status` directly and re-render when it moves. Nothing subscribes by
// hand, and nothing else in the app owns a copy of it.
