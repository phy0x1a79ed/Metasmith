// The ink a DAG is drawn in, fetched once from the server.
//
// `metasmith.models.dag_renderer` defines the dark theme as the light one with
// only its colours replaced, precisely so a marker's shape, its scale and its
// stroke weight cannot differ between them -- the two are meant to be one
// drawing in two inks. Restating any of that in a stylesheet gives the guarantee
// away, so the page asks for it instead. Both themes arrive together because the
// theme toggle must not cost a round trip.
//
// One exception is deliberate. A hollow marker's fill is the plate's background
// hex in the served theme, because a file on disk cannot know what it will sit
// on; drawn here it sits on a card whose ground the page already owns, so the
// component substitutes that and the marker reads hollow wherever it is put.

import { api } from './api.svelte.js'

// a usable drawing before the fetch lands, and the one it falls back to if the
// route is unreachable -- shapes and weights matching `dag_renderer.STYLES`
