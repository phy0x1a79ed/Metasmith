// copies of the ones that decide *layout*, and they live here rather than in a
// view because both the recipe card and the workflow view ask them, and a row
// that draws one way in one place and another in the other is a bug nobody can
// see.
//
// There is no syntax here any more. Whether a field holds its own text or reads
// a column of the sheet is decided by whether a sheet is attached, and by
// nothing written inside the field -- so braces are ordinary characters and
// there is nothing to parse.

// What a value row holds: an ordered list of `{key, value, column}`. One unkeyed
// entry is a plain typed value and writes its text verbatim; anything else
// writes the JSON object the pairs describe. `ops.rows.entries` is the same
// read, and a row written before the list existed carries a single `value`
// string -- read here, never written back.

 * fingerprinted at all: a row read off disk and the same row built by
 * `addInput` are otherwise two different strings for one recipe, and the
 * fingerprint would move across a reload that changed nothing.
 *
 * Read defensively, because a request body is stored verbatim and has no schema
 * behind it -- the same tolerance `ops.rows` extends on the server. `mint`
 * supplies an id for a row that somehow has none.
