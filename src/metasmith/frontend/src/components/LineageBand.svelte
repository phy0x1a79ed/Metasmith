  // One half of the recipe: a lineage rail down the left, the rows themselves
  // down the right, and the measuring that keeps the two in the same coordinate
  // space.
  //
  // This exists because the inputs and the outputs were two copies of it, and
  // the copies had drifted -- one animated its reorder and the other did not
  // reorder at all. What differs between the halves is what a row *says*, which
  // arrives as a snippet; everything about how a row sits beside a rail is the
  // same question twice and is answered here.
  //
  // The rows arrive already in the order they are to be drawn. That order is
  // the recipe's, not this component's -- and it has to be the same array the
  // rail is told about, because `LineageRail` sends the order up with its
  // layout request and a rail laid out in one order against a DOM laid out in
  // another crosses the markers it was told to avoid.

  // a value row wraps, an array row grows a count note, so nothing here is
  // uniform the way a plan DAG's steps are. The column is `position: relative`,
  // so a child's own `offsetTop` is already relative to it; observing the
  // *column* rather than each row catches a single row growing too, since that
  // always changes the column's own height.
