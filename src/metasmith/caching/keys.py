# Cache-key epoch. Baked into every lineage_key so a bump renders pre-epoch
# cache shards unreachable; the sqlite metadata row in CacheStore mirrors it
# for runtime checks. Bumped 2 -> 3 in R5 when the lineage signature began
# folding the transform's protocol-body identity (F1 fix). Bumped 3 -> 4 when a
# step's inputs began naming the producing step's slot id instead of the
# transform archetype's, so a downstream key now moves when its producer does.
# Bumped 4 -> 5 when the unit became one group member's invocation, keyed on
# the own-ids that member consumed, and a slot id lost its step order.
# Bumped 5 -> 6 when staging stopped re-deriving the identity of an input the
# client staged out of its own library: those ids moved once, from the agent's
# reading of the plan-named staged path to the client's reading of its own copy,
# so every shard written before this answers to a key nothing will ask for.
#
# NOT bumped for the import-identity reversal, and the reason is a campaign's
# rather than a principle. Every key that reversal touches moves on its own
# arithmetic, so no shard can be served under a key that now means something
# else and there is nothing an epoch would protect against. The decisive
# argument is that a campaign's headline number is the shared-prefix reuse
# between two batches that must run on one pinned engine: a bump landing
# between them does not degrade that measurement, it deletes it. Say so before
# a future bump lands rather than after.
#
# DELIBERATELY SEPARATE from LIN_PAYLOAD_VERSION below: the cache epoch tracks
# cache-key *semantics*, whereas the wire version tracks the Nextflow-channel
# envelope *shape*. They were one constant until R5; bumping it for the F1
# cache-key change silently broke the on-wire lin envelope, whose Groovy
# emitter (`workflow.py` -> `Orchestrator.JsonforEcho([v:2, ...])`) hardcoded
# the wire version and did not move in lockstep. Keeping them independent
# means a future cache-semantics bump never again desyncs the wire protocol.
CACHE_KEY_VERSION = 6

# On-wire LinPayload envelope version (models/lineage.py). Tracks the SHAPE of
# the `{"v": N, "entries": [...]}` value carried on the Nextflow channel. Do
# not bump this for cache-key changes (bump CACHE_KEY_VERSION instead) — only
# when the envelope shape itself changes.
#
# v3: `entries` is a LIST of per-batch-member maps, matching the list of
#     indexes `_collateBatch` builds. v2 carried a single map (`index[0]`),
#     which silently discarded every member after the first.
# v4: each member may carry `PROV` -- the per-item index maps, one per entry
#     of `FILES`, kept un-flattened so a protocol can ask which item of one
#     grouped slot another item descends from. Additive, but NOT compatible:
#     a v3 parser hashes every value of the raw entry and dies on a nested
#     one, and the `.nf` is written by the client's metasmith while bootstrap
#     runs from the agent container's, so the two ends can be different
#     builds. The bump turns that into a named refusal.
# v5: each member carries `KEY`, its cache key as minted on the channel before
#     submission ("-" when the member has no identity to key on). The task
#     names its products by it and promotes under it.
#
# The emitter interpolates this constant (`nextflow_codegen.LIN_ECHO_EXPR`)
# rather than restating it, so emitter and parser cannot drift.
