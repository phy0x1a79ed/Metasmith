#: Refiner iterations, the shipped default.
#:
#: 256 was never what made the refiner work. Its winner is found by iteration 3
#: on every case that has one, and its frontier exhausts by 16 even when 256 is
#: asked for -- 256 is only what let it run away on a plan whose state space does
#: not exhaust. Re-derived after the lineage repair rather than carried forward:
#: over 44 case-seed pairs, budgets of 4, 8 and 16 give plan fingerprints
#: byte-identical to 256, and two pairs differ from a budget of 0, so 0 is not
#: safe.
#:
#: **It has to be the only default.** Wiring it into the solver alone left it
#: unreachable: every caller from `solve_by_mcts` upward kept its own literal 256
#: and forwarded it, so the budget that shipped stayed 256 and nothing said so.
#: Every layer above now forwards `None` and `solve_by_mcts` resolves it here.
