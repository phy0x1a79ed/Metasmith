"""A client's read of an agent's pool, wherever that agent's home is.

The pool a plan's givens come from lives in the agent home, which is usually a
cluster the client cannot reach into. It does not have to: a given is a name, a
type and an identity, and all three are records the pool already keeps. So this
asks the agent's own metasmith what it holds and reads the answer, rather than
fetching anything.

**Read, never materialize.** A resolved reference carries a path, and that path
is meaningful on the agent's filesystem alone. Nothing here opens one, and a
caller that tries is asking for the store-staging job this deliberately is not.
The client never needs the bytes, because the identity is a record rather than
a derivation from them -- which is the whole reason an import assigns one.

The transport is one ssh command, the same as every other remote read on the
agent. `./msm` is the wrapper the deploy writes, so the pool is read by the
engine that owns it and this end parses JSON instead of a database file.
