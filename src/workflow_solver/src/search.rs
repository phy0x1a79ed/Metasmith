//! Applications, and the pieces both search phases are built from.
//!
//! An `Application` in Python is a transform plus the endpoints bound to its
//! requirements, and it is the object the whole solver is keyed on, by a string
//! signature rebuilt and re-hashed on every use. Here it is an arena entry with
//! an interned signature, and the two are different things on purpose.
//!
//! **`ApplId` is identity; `ApplSig` is structure.** Python conflates them
//! behind one string, and that conflation is a live defect: `expand_node`
//! removes the step it is swapping with
//! `[s for s in state.steps if s.Signature() != step.Signature()]`, which drops
//! *both* members of a colliding pair. Collisions are not hash accidents -- two
//! duplicate transforms genuinely share a structural key, and applications of
//! them with the same inputs genuinely have one signature -- so they are
//! semantics and they survive the port. The defect survives with them,
//! deliberately: this is a port, and a port that fixes things cannot be checked
//! against what it replaced.
//!
//! `SolverState.have` is built and copied on every expansion in Python and never
//! read. It is not carried here.
