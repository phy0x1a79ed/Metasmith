//! The wire format between the Python planner and this binary.
//!
//! It is a real interface with two independent implementations, so it carries a
//! version from the first commit rather than from the first time it breaks. The
//! scar tissue is `LIN_PAYLOAD_VERSION`, which drifted from its second
//! (Groovy) implementation and failed every containerized task while the fast
//! suite stayed green: a version constant only helps if it is shared and
//! checked, and a *single* constant covering two things that can move
//! independently is how the last desync went unnoticed. Hence two constants.
//!
//! `WIRE_VERSION` covers the envelope -- field names, framing, how a request
//! and a reply are shaped. `SOLVER_RNG_VERSION` (in `rng`) covers the decision
//! contract. A change to either is a change the other side must agree to, and
//! they move for different reasons.
//!
//! Floats have to survive the crossing unchanged, and by default they did not.
//! `serde_json` documents its float parsing as *best effort* -- roughly twice as
//! fast, and not always the double the writer wrote. It read
//! `0.9999999999999999` as exactly `1.0`, and read other perfectly ordinary
//! values a few ulps off. That is not a rounding curiosity: the scores these
//! numbers become are compared, and comparisons decide plans. The
//! `float_roundtrip` feature in `Cargo.toml` is therefore load-bearing, and
//! `tests` below pins it.
//!
//! Non-finite floats are the one place the format is not plain JSON: `NaN` and
//! `Infinity` are not JSON, Python's `json` emits them anyway and `serde_json`
//! rejects them. Since NaN *ranking* is part of the decision contract, the wire
//! cannot quietly not support NaN -- so a score is either a JSON number or one
//! of the strings below, on both sides.
