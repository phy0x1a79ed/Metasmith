"""A step that died is not a run that succeeded.

Pins I3 of the annotation-trio investigation. The shipped local preset ends its
`errorStrategy` in `ignore`, which is the right call for a twelve-sample run --
one dead annotator should not destroy the other eleven. What is not right is
that the driver then reports the run completed, with the dead step's product
missing and nothing naming it. The reporter was told their InterProScan run had
finished when it had produced nothing at all.
