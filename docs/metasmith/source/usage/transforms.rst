Transforms
############################################################

.. role:: python(code)
    :language: python

The manipulation of raw data to interpretable insights typically involves a series of computational steps,
each of which transforms inputs of specific data types to outputs of other data types. Metasmith can be
taught to use computational tools and perform standard protocols by defining transforms.

Similar to how metasmith manages data, a :python:`Transform` specifies the input and output :python:`Endpoints`
for a :python:`TransformInstance`, which contains the explicit computational protocol. :python:`TransformInstances`
are then stored together in a :python:`TransformInstanceLibrary`.

Transform Instance Library
===========================================================

This section will show how to define transforms for 2 commonly used bioinformatics tools, Prodigal[1] and BLAST[2].
Prodigal is a gene prediction tool that identifies `open reading frames (ORFs) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_reading_frame>`_ 
in a given nucleotide sequence. BLAST is a sequence alignment tool that compares a query sequence to a database of sequences.
Together, they can be chained to predict genes within a nucleotide sequence and annotate them with functional information.

Start by creating a :python:`TransformInstanceLibrary` called "simple_genomics". This will create a folder with the same name in
the current directory. 

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    from metasmith import TransformInstanceLibrary
    transforms = TransformInstanceLibrary("./simple_genomics")

At least one :python:`DataTypeLibrary` must be added to define the types of the inputs and outputs of each transform.
The data types provided by the "minimal_genomics" example types library is sufficient for this section.

.. note::

    `How to create a data type library <data.html#data-type-library>`_

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    from metasmith import examples
    dtypes = examples.DataTypeLibraries("minimal_genomics")
    transforms.AddTypeLibrary("genomics", dtypes)

Next, a template is created for each transform.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    transforms.AddStub("prodigal")
    transforms.AddStub("blast")
    transforms.Save()

At this point, the directory structure of :python:`transforms` should look like this...

.. code-block::

    example.xgdb/
    ├── _metasmith/
    │   ├── index.yml
    │   └── types/
    │       ├── genomics.yml
    │       └── transforms.yml
    ├── blast.py
    └── prodigal.py

... and the contents of :python:`prodigal.py` and :python:`blast.py` should look like this:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    from pathlib import Path
    from metasmith.python_api import *

    lib = TransformInstanceLibrary.ResolveParentLibrary(__file__)
    model = Transform()
    dep     = model.AddRequirement(node=lib.GetType("transforms::example_input"))
    out     = model.AddProduct(lib.GetType("transforms::example_output"))

    def protocol(context: ExecutionContext):
        out_path = context.Get(out)
        context.external_shell.Exec(f"touch {out_path.external}")
        return ExecutionResult(success=out_path.local.exists())

    TransformInstance(
        protocol = protocol,
        model = model,
        output_signature = {
            out: "output.txt",
        },
        resources = Resources(
            cpus = 4,
            memory = Size.GB(16),
            duration = Duration(days=1, hours=12, minutes=30),
        )
    )

- Data types are provided by the parent library, which is obtained on line 4
- lines 5-7 define the input and output data types for the transform.
- Data types are referred to by "namespace:type"
- The computational protocol where either prodigal or blast will be executed starts on line 9
- This definition is published to the library by creating a :python:`TransformInstance` on line 14
- Note that the output file name is specified on line 18

Execution context
-----------------------------------------------------------

A :python:`ExecutionContext` object will be provided to the protocol at runtime. It will contain:

- the paths to inputs and expected outputs :python:`context.Get(lib.GetType("namespace::type"))`
- access to a `bash <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)>`_ terminal environment :python:`context.external_shell`
- a declaration of how the tool runs in each world :python:`context.ExecWithEnv().ifContainerDo(env, cmd).ifVirtualEnvDo(env, cmd)`
- and additional parameters like CPU and memory limits :python:`context.params`

Prodigal Example
-----------------------------------------------------------

Prodigal accepts a contiguous nucleotide sequence or "contig" and produces a list of predicted ORFs as amino acid sequences in fasta format.
Additionally, the container providing the prodigal itself is specified as an input. The syntax for running prodigal can be obtained
from studying its `documentation <https://github.com/hyattpd/prodigal/wiki/Gene-Prediction-Modes#normal-mode>`_.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    from pathlib import Path
    from metasmith.python_api import *

    lib = TransformInstanceLibrary.ResolveParentLibrary(__file__)
    model = Transform()
    contigs = model.AddRequirement(node=lib.GetType("genomics::contigs"))
    image   = model.AddRequirement(node=lib.GetType("genomics::oci_image_prodigal"))
    orfs    = model.AddProduct(lib.GetType("genomics::aa_sequences"))

    def protocol(context: ExecutionContext):
        out_path = context.Get(orfs)
        context.ExecWithEnv().ifContainerDo(
            env = image,
            cmd = f"""\
                prodigal \
                    -i {context.Get(contigs).container} \
                    -a {out_path.container} \
                    -f gff \
                    -o {out_path.container.with_suffix('.gff')} \
                """,
        )
        return ExecutionResult(success=out_path.local.exists())

    TransformInstance(
        protocol = protocol,
        model = model,
        output_signature = {
            orfs: "orfs.faa",
        },
    )

BLAST Example
-----------------------------------------------------------

Similarly, BLAST requires a query sequence and a database of sequences to compare against. For simplicity,
another fasta file will be used instead of a true BLAST database. The syntax for running BLAST can also be 
obtained from studying its `documentation <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279690/>`_.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    from pathlib import Path
    from metasmith.python_api import *

    lib = TransformInstanceLibrary.ResolveParentLibrary(__file__)
    model = Transform()
    orfs    = model.AddRequirement(node=lib.GetType("genomics::aa_sequences"))
    refdb   = model.AddRequirement(node=lib.GetType("genomics::protein_reference_fasta"))
    image   = model.AddRequirement(node=lib.GetType("genomics::oci_image_blast"))
    annot   = model.AddProduct(lib.GetType("genomics::orf_annotations"))

    def protocol(context: ExecutionContext):
        out_path = context.Get(annot)
        COLUMNS = f"qseqid sseqid bitscore evalue pident"
        context.ExecWithEnv().ifContainerDo(
            env = image,
            cmd = f"""\
                blastp \
                    -query {context.Get(orfs).container} \
                    -subject {context.Get(refdb).container} \
                    -outfmt "6 {COLUMNS}" \
                    -out {out_path.container} \
                """,
        )
        return ExecutionResult(success=out_path.local.exists())

    TransformInstance(
        protocol = protocol,
        model = model,
        output_signature = {
            annot: "annotations.csv",
        },
    )

Alternative outputs
===========================================================

Some tools end in one of several ways. An SRA accession yields long reads, paired reads or single
reads, and only the run's metadata says which. Declare each way as its own product group.
:python:`AddProduct` adds to the current group, and :python:`NewProductGroup` starts the next one.

.. code-block:: python

    long     = model.AddProduct(lib.GetType("sequences::long_reads"))
    model.NewProductGroup()
    short_pe = model.AddProduct(lib.GetType("sequences::short_reads_pe"))
    model.NewProductGroup()
    short_se = model.AddProduct(lib.GetType("sequences::short_reads_se"))

Metasmith plans a route to the target below every group. Planning fails if any group has no route,
and the hint names the transform and the group. Products the tool always writes together belong in
one group, so do not call :python:`NewProductGroup` between them.

The protocol reports what it wrote. The manifest holds one dict per group, and each dict names every
product of its group. A task may write several groups. The run fails the task when a dict matches no
declared group, or when the manifest is empty.

.. code-block:: python

    return ExecutionResult(manifest=[{short_pe: reads.local}], success=reads.local.exists())

``transforms/logistics/getSraReads.py`` in the standard library is a complete example.

Running one transform
===========================================================

Run a single transform against files you already have. The solver does not plan a workflow.
Nextflow does not run. The protocol executes through the same code that runs a workflow step, so a
transform that works here works in a generated workflow.

Use this to check a protocol while you write it. A full workflow is the slower way to learn that a
command line is wrong.

Three things must exist first.

1. The transform's library is compiled. :python:`TransformInstanceLibrary.Save` compiles it, and so
   does ``msm build``. A library with no compiled :python:`_metadata/` cannot be loaded at all.
2. An agent is deployed. The agent supplies the runtime that the protocol's tool environment needs.
3. Your inputs are registered in a `data instance library <./data.html>`_. ``-i`` names an item in
   that library, never a filesystem path.

.. code-block:: bash
    :caption: Terminal

    $ msm run simple_genomics/prodigal.py \
        -d ./inputs.xgdb \
        -i contigs=sample_00/contigs.fna \
        -i image=prodigal.env \
        -w ./prodigal_out

Metasmith finds the transform library by walking up from the transform file. It takes the nearest
parent directory that holds a compiled :python:`_metadata/`.

Name each input after the variable it was assigned to in the transform. The prodigal transform
above declares :python:`contigs` and :python:`image`, so those are the names ``-i`` accepts. A
product is not an input and cannot be bound. Repeat one name to give that input several items,
which is what :python:`context.InputGroup` reads.

.. code-block:: bash
    :caption: Terminal

    $ msm run ani_transforms/fastani.py \
        -d ./inputs.xgdb \
        -i pan=pangenome.txt \
        -i asm=genome_1.fna \
        -i asm=genome_2.fna \
        -i image=fastani.env

Name the agent with ``--agent-home``, or set ``AGENT_HOME``. A run inside an agent's own shell
finds it already set.

Products land in the working directory. Metasmith names each product from its lineage and lists
every one at the end of the run.

The library is not paperwork. It is the channel a generated workflow uses, and binding through it
is what makes the two paths agree: an item carries the type you declared for it and the parents you
recorded, so :python:`context.SourceOf` answers here exactly as it does in a DAG. Binding bare paths
gave every input an empty ancestry, and a collecting transform asking which sample a file came from
got nothing back.

.. caution::

    Nothing checks the item against the slot. The type you declared **is** the statement of what
    the file is, and Metasmith never opens the data to second-guess it — verifying that a folder of
    600,000 profiles really is a profile database is not tractable, which is the whole reason types
    are declarations here.

This path keeps no cache and reuses no earlier result. Every run executes the protocol. Once the
transform behaves, generate a workflow to run it at scale over many samples. See
`Workflow generation <./workflow_generation.html>`_.
