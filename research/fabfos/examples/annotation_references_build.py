"""Build the five references the four canonical annotation lanes need, and pin them.

    python examples/annotation_references_build.py                 # plan + DAG only
    python examples/annotation_references_build.py --preflight     # what fir must hold
    python examples/annotation_references_build.py --run           # execute on fir
    python examples/annotation_references_build.py --retrieve      # pull the results down
    python examples/annotation_references_build.py --publish       # land them in data/processed/

This is the EXECUTING sibling of `examples/annotation_references_dag.py`. That one
proves the graph resolves from nothing -- no givens, every leaf a download -- on a
machine holding none of the bytes. This one runs it here, where the six upstream
distributions are already acquired and DVC-pinned under `data/originals/`, so the
six acquire steps are staged away and only the four compiles run.

WHICH REFERENCES, AND WHY EXACTLY THESE FIVE
--------------------------------------------
    kofamscan_profiles + kofamscan_ko_list   the HMM lane          (one chunk)
    uniref50_diamond_db                      the homology lane
    mnxr_lookup                              EVERY lane's terminus
    label_transfer_landmarks                     the ProteinBERT kNN lane

CLEAN and ProteinBERT get no artifact each, and the asymmetry is not an oversight:
their weights are baked into their images, so under a container runtime there is
nothing for a transform to acquire. What R7 builds is the labelled POOL, not the
model. The build's entire obligation to the CLEAN lane is the `ec` route of
mnxr_lookup.

The profiles and the ko_list share ONE chunk. They are one artifact in two files:
the list carries each family's score threshold, and a threshold applied to a
profile from a different build is silently the wrong cut on every hit.

THIS RUNS ON FIR, AND THE SOURCES ARE ALREADY THERE
-----------------------------------------------------
Two of the four compiles are what a workstation cannot promise: the DIAMOND build reads
an 8.2 GB fasta, and the label pool embeds 222k Swiss-Prot sequences. The pool step was
SIGTERM'd at 29 minutes on this desktop under kernel page-allocation failures with 1 GB
free of 68. A scheduler either grants the ask or queues; it does not starve.

The six source folders are uploaded once to `--remote-originals` and declared at their
ABSOLUTE fir paths, which is what makes metasmith bind them in place instead of staging
11.4 GB through the task. `--sync-sources` does the upload and is idempotent.

WHY THIS IS A CONTAINER RUN AND THE METABOLISM BAKE IS NOT
-----------------------------------------------------------
`Agent.runtime` is one global setting, so a graph whose envs cannot all satisfy it
does not run. `proteinbert.env` publishes only an image and has no `conda:` key at
all; the metabolism bake's `build-refs-*` envs are the mirror image, conda specs
with no published image. The two halves are separate runs by construction.

logistics/ IS NOT LOADED, and this asserts it. That library carries downloaders
producing the same `ref::` types compile/ does, and two producers for one reference
makes provenance a planner tiebreak.

WHERE THE OUTPUT LANDS
----------------------
`--publish` copies each reference to `data/processed/<name>/`. Two levels, not
three: `data/.gitignore` excludes by the shape `/*/*` and re-includes only
`!/*/*.dvc`, so a pin any deeper is invisible to git AND makes DVC scatter a second
ignore file -- breaking the one invariant the data layer has. Pin with

    dvc add data/processed/<name>

# fir's cpubase nodes are 192 cores / 768 GB, so these asks are modest there and were
# not on a desktop. The two poles: DIAMOND over an 8.2 GB fasta, and ProteinBERT over
# the ~222k reviewed Swiss-Prot accessions the bridge selects.
#
# The pool's memory is the number that changed. It died locally at 142 of ~217 batches
# with the host at 1 GB free; the fix is not a smaller batch but an allocation that is
# actually reserved. TensorFlow sizes its arena off the visible core count, so cpus and
# memory move together.
#
# The DURATIONS are deliberately near the measured cost rather than generously above
# it. A walltime is not free optimism: SLURM refuses to start a job that cannot finish
# before a reservation covering the nodes it needs, and fir's maintenance windows carry
# ALL_NODES -- so a 12 h ask made both poles unschedulable with hundreds of nodes idle,
# PENDING on `ReqNodeNotAvail` forever rather than failing. `check_walltimes` reports
