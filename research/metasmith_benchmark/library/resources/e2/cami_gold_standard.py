"""Builds an AMBER gold-standard table over one sample's OWN assembly contigs.

CAMI's published binning_gs.tsv/gsa_mapping.tsv.gz key on the CAMI-provided
gold-standard-assembly's own contig ids (e.g. S9C933009), which share no id
space with a participant's own assembly (e.g. megahit's k141_N). Comparing a
self-assembled contig_to_bin_table against binning_gs.tsv directly would join
on nothing. This script instead majority-votes each of OUR contigs against
CAMISIM's per-read truth table (reads_mapping.tsv.gz), using the same sample's
own alignment::bam to say which reads landed on which contig -- the same idea
CAMI's own gsa_mapping.tsv.gz used its "number_reads" column for, just applied
to a different assembly.

Read ids are matched with a trailing /1 or /2 stripped on both sides: whether
an aligner keeps that suffix in QNAME is aligner- and version-dependent, and
neither side can be trusted to already agree with the other.
