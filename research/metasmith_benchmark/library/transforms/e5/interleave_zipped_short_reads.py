    # unbgzip=f is load-bearing, not tidying. By default bbmap sends EVERY .gz
    # through its BGZF reader (ReadWrite.getGZipInputStream), which then splits
    # the stream on block boundaries that plain gzip does not have. Above a few
    # hundred MB the split lands mid-deflate and the reader thread dies with
    # "Not a gzip file" while the process keeps waiting -- so the task hangs
    # instead of failing, and SLURM, nextflow and any log-watching monitor all
    # report it as RUNNING. unbgzip=f falls through to external pigz, which is
    # both correct on multi-member gzip and faster. Do not remove it without
    # re-testing on a >1 GB library, and check READ COUNTS, not exit codes:
    # multithreadedbgzf=f, the other obvious knob, exits 0 having silently
    # dropped 90% of the reads.
    #
    # The same latent bug is in interleave_short_reads, ora2fastq, filtlong,
    # sylph, ganon2 and phyloflash. They are untouched because the run that
    # found this did not exercise them, and an untested edit is not a fix.
